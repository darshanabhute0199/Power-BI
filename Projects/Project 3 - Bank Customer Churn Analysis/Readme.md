# Project : Bank Customer Churn Analysis


## Introduction
- Customer churn poses a significant challenge to the banking industry, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to analyze customer data to identify factors contributing to customer churn and develop predictive models to identify customers at risk of leaving the bank. By understanding the underlying reasons for churn, the bank can implement targeted retention strategies to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- This analysis will involve exploring customer demographics, product usage, transaction patterns, and other relevant factors to uncover trends and correlations associated with churn. Ultimately, the goal is to provide actionable insights to help the bank proactively address customer needs and prevent churn.
